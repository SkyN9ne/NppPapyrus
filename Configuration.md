# Configuration
Most of the plugin's behavior can be modified in Settings dialog. However, if it's needed to change the
settings file "Papyrus.ini" directly, it can be found in "plugins\config" directory under Notepad++'s data
folder, which by default is "%APPDATA%\Notepad++".

The following are settings that can be changed in Settings dialog.

## Lexer tab
### Folding behavior
By default, the lexer will split folding when it encounters "else" and "elseif", i.e. "if" block will be
folded by itself, and "else"/"elseif" block will be folded by itself, until terminated by "endif". If this
behavior is not desired, disable this option.

### Class names caching
When a script file references other scripts (referred to as *class* hereafter), default lexer behavior is
to check the file name every time a word is not recognized as other types, even if the same word has been
previously checked and determined as a class or not a class. This usually should be fast, but in a script
file that repeatedly references the same classes many times, it may be desired to cache checked class names
to reduce number of I/O operations. This can be achieve by enabling this option.

However, there is a caveat, that when *a new script file* is generated in one of the import directories,
the new class name may not be dynamically recognized, if the name has already been checked and treated as
"not a class name". When this happens, simply disable the option to force the lexer to re-check for class
names. Afterwards the option can be enabled again.

### Class names as links
Since classes reference other script files, it would be convenient to be able to open those files without
going through open file dialog. By enabling this feature, every class name is shown as a link. When hovering
over, the style will change to the configured style. By default, the link is shown as underlined, with
blue foreground and white background (kind of a web standard). It requires double click to activate while
single click can still move cursor to the word without triggering the activation. If needed, both the
behavior of requiring double click and a keyboard modifier can be configured in Papyrus.ini. Be warned,
single click behavior usually causes large amount of text gets selected in the newly opened file window.

### Papyrus Script Lexer styles
These styles can be configured from Notepad++'s Style Configurator dialog under Settings menu. A convenient
link is provided.

## Error Annotator tab
When Papyrus compiler reports compilation errors, original plugin can show the list of errors in a window,
where user can click on a row to jump to the error line of that file. In addition to this behavior, this
plugin is also capable of showing directly in the editor window where errors are reported.

### Annotation
Show annotations under error lines. They are inside a round box. By default, the font is italic with red
foreground and bright grey background. When there are multiple errors on the same line, they are grouped
in the same annotation box.

### Indication
Show indications where errors happen. By default, the indicator is a red squiggly line under the word or
operator where error is, similar to what a spell checker does. There are many styles to choose from.

Usually the default indicator ID won't conflict with other plugins. However, there is no guarantee that
will never happen, so this plugin allows you to choose a different indicator if there is a conflict. The
valid numbers are between 9 and 20. Keep in mind other plugins may use indicator IDs as well, for example,
DSpellCheck uses 19. Make sure you **do not** touch it if everything works fine.

*Note*, after changing it, existing indications may be rendered incorrectly if edits have been made. You
can recompile the script to make them show correctly again, or simply fix all your script bugs. ðŸ˜€


## Compiler

### Compiler mode
This plugin automatically detects supported games (Skyrim, Skyrim SE, Fallout 4), and select Auto mode by
default. In Auto mode, if a script is loaded from a folder under a detected game, that game's settings
will be used to compile the script. If the script is from a location outside of any game's install path,
the default game configured for Auto mode will be used to compile the script, and in this case, the output
of compilation will be placed under configured default output directory, instead of that game's configured
output folder.

You can also choose a specific game to be used for all script files, but be warned, doing so means that
even if you are editing a script from another game, designated game's compiler settings will be used and
likely that would cause unexpected result. If unsure, just use Auto mode.

Obviously if no game is detected, the plugin will not be able to choose a compiler. If somehow a game is
installed but registry key is not present (hmmm...), you an still manually enable the game and configure
all settings in that game's tab. Whenever a game is enabled, the game's configuration tab will be added.

If for whatever reason you don't want the plugin to use a detected game, you can disable it manually. If
this game is currently selected as Auto mode's default game, the next game in the list will be automatically
chosen instead. Whenever a game is disabled, the game's configuration tab will be removed.

For each game, a convenient button "Configure" is provided to go directly to that game's configuration
tab.

### Allow compiling files not recognized as Papyrus script

This setting allows the compiler to compile a script file that is not selected as "Papyrus Script" in
language menu. It is only useful if you want to use a user-defined language instead of using the lexer
provided by this plugin, or for some reason you don't want to use syntax highlighting at all...


## Games

Each enabled game will have its own configuration tab. Most configurations are self-explanatory, and you
usually should just leave the default values untouched. There are a few checkboxes:

### Anonymize generated PEX
This setting allow you to anonymize the generated PEX file. In case you are not aware, when you use
PapyrusCompiler to compile any script your user account and machine name are stored inside the generated
.pex file. In FO4's case, the whole path to the source .psc file is also stored there. Very sneaky,
Bethesda!

Since this is a big **privacy concern**, this plugin provide a way to anonymize those info by replacing
all of them with dashes. You are recommended to leave it checked, unless you want to showcase your fancy
machine name to the whole modding world. ðŸ˜€

### Optimize flag
This setting instructs Papyrus compiler to optimize output ("-op"). Not sure how much that helps but it's
usually not a bad thing. However, there are cases that compilation would pass but the compiler then chokes
at the assembly file (.pas). If that happens, temporarily disable this flag and compile the script.

### Release flag
This setting only applies to Fallout 4. It instructs Papyrus compiler to use release mode ("-r"), which
removes all debugOnly function calls and optimizes the output, supposedly reducing the output size.

### Final flag
This setting only applies to Fallout 4. It instructs Papyrus compiler to use final mode ("-final"), which
removes all betaOnly  function calls and optimizes the output, supposedly reducing the output size.
